# Smart Mirror
For my project I am building a smart mirror than runs using a Raspberry Pi. The mirror displays information like time, weather, and news to the user.

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone --->

My project is a smart mirror that runs on Raspberry Pi which runs the code to display time, weather, and news. At this milestone, I was able to get the Raspberry Pi running. To get it to run, I first connected it to a capture card which streamed the screen output of the Raspberry Pi to my laptop using OBS. With this, I was able to change the settings of the Pi so that ssh could be used. After doing that, I returned to my laptop and pinged the Pi in the Terminal and then used the ssh command to connect to it. Then, I used Tiger VNC to remotely view and control my Raspberry Pi without needing to use the capture card. Finally, I installed Visual Studio Code to code on my computer and send it to the Raspberry Pi. A challenge I faced was that I had forgotten the password to my Raspberry Pi so I needed assistance to reset it. I plan to complete the project by first coding the Raspberry Pi and then assembling my mirror.

<!---# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Starter Project

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HlC0FD95Rxc?si=TMSMpwka0znPHmGE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

For my starter project I made a retro arcade console which plays Tetris. It works by connecting components with a circuit board. These components are buttons, a screen, an on off toggle, and a battery pack. Some challenges that I faced while making this learning how to soder and sodering on the USB port the wrong way around.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
